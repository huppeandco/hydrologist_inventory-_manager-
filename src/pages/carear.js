                    At Hydrologist, we prioritize merit and professional expertise when selecting and appointing talented individuals. However, it has come to our attention that some individuals/entities are falsely impersonating or representing themselves as representatives of Hydrologist. They are deceitfully requesting money, claiming to offer employment through the circulation of counterfeit job offer letters, while using the name and logo of Hydrologist We strongly caution against engaging with such fraudulent activities.
